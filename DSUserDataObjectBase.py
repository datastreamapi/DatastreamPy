Datastream User Created Items
-----------------------------

Datastream permits users to create and manage custom items. Five user created item types are supported:

    Timeseries - Upload your own timeseries data to Datastreamâ€™s central systems. These can then be used in combination with Datastream maintained series in charts 
                    and data requests with the full power of the Datastream expressions language.
    Lists - Create and manage your own lists of constituent items. These can then be used to request static data for the constituents of the lists.
    Expressions - Combine Datastream data items with analytical functions to create custom expressions.
    Indices - Create an index based on a portfolio of instruments and and measure the performance against variations on established market indices and other benchmarks.
    Regression - Create a regression model to analyse the extent to which one time series (the dependent variable) is influenced by other time series.

Each of these five user created types have their own object model. However, some parameters, such as the last modified time (LastModified), are common to all five 
types. This module defines the DSUserObjectBase class common to all types plus the supporting objects and enums that permit clients to manage their user created items.

This module also contains some basic datetime conversions to and from JSON plus some basic logging functionality common to the objects
